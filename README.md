This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

# üìò EventHub ‚Äî Milestone 2: API Specification & Implementation

## üß© Problem Statement
EventHub aims to simplify event discovery by combining **event data**, **weather forecasts**, and **AI-powered recommendations** in one platform.  
Users can explore local or national events, see live weather predictions for each venue, and chat with an assistant that generates contextual suggestions and accessibility insights.

---

## üß† Justification & API Choices

| API | Purpose | Reason for Selection |
|------|----------|----------------------|
| **Ticketmaster Discovery API** | Retrieves detailed event data including location, date, category, and ticket pricing. | Reliable, public, and easy JSON integration for large event coverage. |
| **Open-Meteo API** | Fetches weather forecasts for event locations. | Free, no-key API ideal for real-time weather pairing with events. |
| **Together.ai GPT-OSS 20B (LLM)** | Generates human-like text responses for the EventHub Assistant. | Low-cost open-source model that supports chat, reasoning, and contextual recommendations. |
| *(Future)* Wheelmap / Accessibility API | Provides venue accessibility data. | Planned for future milestone integration to improve inclusivity. |

---

## üß≠ System Endpoints

| Endpoint | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|--------------|
| `/api/tools/search-events` | POST | Returns normalized Ticketmaster event objects based on user query, coordinates, and date filters. |
| `/api/tools/weather` | POST | Returns weather data (temp F/C + summary) for specified latitude/longitude. |
| `/api/chat` | POST | Sends message array to Together.ai model and returns generated reply. |
| `/events` | Page | Displays list of events with integrated API data. |
| `/assistant` | Page | Interactive UI that connects to the LLM for conversation and recommendations. |
